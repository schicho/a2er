# a2er
Fun browser extension, changing all words ending with `a` to end with `er`.

This started as a joke between friends and me, pronouncing words ending with an a or an a in the last syllable,
as if it was er instead.

Annoyed of Java? Try Javer.

Going down a Wikipedier rabbithole about a country's locerl florer and fauner while drinking cocer coler just
became even better!
